After freeing them, <i>all the girls requested Shri Krishna to marry them as the society would never accept them.</i> So they pleaded Lord Krishna to accept them because nobody else is going to marry them and if he doesnâ€™t accept them, then they will commit suicide. Being trapped in <b>dharma</b>, Shri Krishna accepted all women as his wives so that they live an honorable life and nobody dares to mock them. To restore their honor and give them the status of queen, Shri Krishna married them. That is how he came to have 16,108 wives.</p>
